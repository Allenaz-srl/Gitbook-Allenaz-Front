# ItemActions.jsx

The `ItemActions` component is a functional React component responsible for rendering action buttons associated with a single notification. These actions typically include marking a notification as read or performing a custom action, such as archiving. The component is designed to be versatile and easy to integrate into different notification layouts.

## 1. **Core Imports and Dependencies**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Check, Archive } from "react-feather";
import style from "./StyleCenter.module.css";
import PulsatingDot from "./PulsatingDot";
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **React**: Essential for creating the component as a functional component.
* **React-Feather Icons**:
  * **Check**: Used to visually represent that a notification has been marked as read.
  * **Archive**: Can be used for additional actions like archiving, though it’s not utilized in the given code snippet.
* **StyleCenter.module.css**: A CSS module that provides scoped styling for the component, ensuring styles do not conflict with other parts of the application.
* **PulsatingDot**: A custom component that renders a pulsating dot, used to indicate an unread notification.

## 2. **Component Structure**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
export default function ItemActions({ notification, markAsRead, remove }) {
  return (
    <div className={style.item_actions_wrapper}>
      {notification.read ? (
        <Check color="green" />
      ) : (
        <button
          className={style.item_actions_button}
          title="Mark as read"
          onClick={() => {
            markAsRead(notification.id);
          }}
        >
          <PulsatingDot />
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **Props**:
  * **notification**: An object representing the notification, typically including properties like `id` and `read`.
  * **markAsRead**: A function that is called to mark the notification as read.
  * **remove**: A function for removing the notification (though not used directly in the provided code).
* **Conditional Rendering**:
  * The component checks if the notification is marked as read (`notification.read`). If it is, a green `Check` icon is displayed, indicating that the notification has already been addressed.
  * If the notification is unread, a button is rendered instead, containing the `PulsatingDot` component. This button, when clicked, triggers the `markAsRead` function, updating the notification’s status.

## 3. **Action Handling**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
<button
  className={style.item_actions_button}
  title="Mark as read"
  onClick={() => {
    markAsRead(notification.id);
  }}
>
  <PulsatingDot />
</button>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **markAsRead**: This function is called with the notification's `id` as an argument when the user clicks the button. It’s typically connected to a state management system that updates the notification status and possibly triggers a UI re-render.
* **PulsatingDot**: The pulsating dot visually draws attention to the unread notification, providing a subtle but noticeable cue for the user to take action.

## 4. **Component Export**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
export default function ItemActions({ notification, markAsRead, remove });
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Export Statement**: The component is exported as the default export, making it easy to import and use in other parts of the application, particularly within the notification items in the Notification Center.
