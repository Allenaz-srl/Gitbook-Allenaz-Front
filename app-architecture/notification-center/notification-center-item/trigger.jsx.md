# Trigger.jsx

The `Trigger.jsx` component serves as the interactive element that allows users to open and access the Notification Center. It provides a visual indicator of the number of unread notifications and triggers the display of the Notification Center when clicked.

## 1. **Core Imports and Dependencies**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Bell } from "react-feather";
import style from "./StyleCenter.module.css";
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **React**: The component is built using React, leveraging functional components for simplicity and reusability.
* **React Feather**: The `Bell` icon from the `react-feather` library is used to symbolize notifications. Feather icons are lightweight and consistent, making them an excellent choice for modern web applications.
* **CSS Module**: The component uses a CSS module (`StyleCenter.module.css`) for scoped styling, ensuring that styles are applied only to this component, avoiding potential conflicts with other parts of the application.

## 2. **Component Structure and Props**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
export default function Trigger({ count, onClick }) {
  return (
    <div className={style.trigger_wrapper} onClick={onClick}>
      <Bell />
      <span className={style.trigger_count}>{count}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **Props**:
  * `count`: An integer representing the number of unread notifications. This is displayed next to the bell icon to inform users of pending notifications.
  * `onClick`: A function that is executed when the user clicks on the Trigger. This function is responsible for toggling the visibility of the Notification Center.
* **JSX Structure**:
  * The component renders a `div` container with a class of `trigger_wrapper`. This container wraps the `Bell` icon and a `span` element that displays the notification count.
  * The `Bell` icon serves as a visual cue for notifications.
  * The `span` element shows the unread notification count, which is dynamically passed as a prop.

## 3. **Interactivity and User Experience**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
<div className={style.trigger_wrapper} onClick={onClick}>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **Interactive Wrapper**: The `onClick` event listener is attached to the wrapper `div`, making the entire area of the `Trigger` component interactive. When a user clicks anywhere within this area, the `onClick` function is executed.
* **User Experience Considerations**:
  * The clickable area is designed to be large enough to ensure that users can easily interact with it, especially on touch devices.
  * The notification count is prominently displayed next to the bell icon, using contrasting colors (red and white) to draw the user's attention.
