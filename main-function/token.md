# Token

The AllyArm application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and secure communication between the frontend and backend. To ensure that these tokens are correctly interpreted, the application includes a utility function for decoding JWTs. This function is defined in the `tokenDecode.jsx` file and is utilized in the main application file, `app.jsx`.

## Token Decoding

The `tokenDecode` function is responsible for decoding JWTs passed to it and extracting the payload, which typically contains important user information and metadata. Hereâ€™s how it works:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
import jwt_decode from "jwt-decode";

const tokenDecode = (token) => {
  try {
    const decodedToken = jwt_decode(token);
    return decodedToken;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error decoding token: ", error);
    return null;
  }
};

export default tokenDecode;
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## How It Works:

1. **JWT Decoding**:
   * The function takes a `token` as its argument, which is expected to be a valid JWT.
   * Using the `jwt_decode` library, the function attempts to decode the token, extracting the payload that contains information such as user ID, roles, and token expiration.
2. **Error Handling**:
   * If the decoding process fails (e.g., if the token is invalid or malformed), the function catches the error and logs it to the console. This ensures that any issues with the token are identified during runtime.
   * In case of an error, the function returns `null`, allowing the application to handle the situation gracefully (e.g., by redirecting the user to a login page or showing an error message).
3. **Return Value**:
   * If decoding is successful, the function returns the decoded token, which can then be used within the application for various purposes, such as validating user sessions or extracting user-specific data.

## Application-Wide Usage

The `tokenDecode` function is used in the main file `app.jsx` to decode tokens received from the backend. This decoded information is crucial for managing user authentication states, controlling access to different parts of the application, and personalizing the user experience based on the decoded data.

By centralizing the token decoding logic in a single function, the application ensures consistent handling of JWTs across all components that require access to user-specific information. This approach also simplifies error management and debugging, as any issues with token decoding are logged and can be addressed directly.
